# leptoskit_router_codegen: the routes generator

`leptoskit_router_codegen` reads a leptoskit `src/routes/` directory and writes its typed `routes.rs`.

The `leptoskit routes` command and the CLI's build pipeline use it; apps never depend on it. It reports every problem with its file and line, and never overwrites a file leptoskit did not write.
