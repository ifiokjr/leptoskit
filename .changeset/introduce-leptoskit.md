# leptoskit: the one dependency

`leptoskit` is the crate an app depends on. It re-exports the components, Tailwind styles, layout engine, renderer, and Wasm runtime, with one feature per optional part, so an app names `leptoskit` alone and never keeps the versions of its parts in step by hand.

Pick how the interface runs: `web` with `csr`, `hydrate`, `ssr`, or `islands` renders through leptos, and a backend feature (`macos`, `ios`, `android`, `linux`, `windows`, or `tui`) commits the same tree as real widgets or as terminal cells. `server` adds the Axum toolkit, and `analytics` beside it keeps request and browser measurements. Everything else is opt-in: `rpc`, `query`, `form`, `aria`, `table`, `virtual`, `l10n`, `rive`, `db` with `db-postgres` or `db-sqlite`, `auth` (passwords, passkeys, and providers through their own `auth-*` features), `idp`, `extension`, `codepush`, and `devtools`. `leptoskit::secrets` reads values that Monosecret, the default secret manager, or a trusted host supplies.
