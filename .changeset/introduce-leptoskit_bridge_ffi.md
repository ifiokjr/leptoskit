# leptoskit_bridge_ffi: the native half of the app host

`leptoskit_bridge_ffi` is the C ABI, plus the Swift, Kotlin, and C++ code, that lets a native app shell host a leptoskit Wasm guest: it runs the guest, forwards its plugin calls, and draws its tree with the platform's own views.

The macOS, iOS, and Android apps `leptoskit new` generates link it, and HarmonyOS links its experimental N-API layer; app authors never add it themselves. Its Swift and Kotlin renderers draw ten components so far, including password fields, and stop on any other with an "unsupported widget" error. The generated Linux and Windows apps use the GTK and Win32 backend crates instead.
