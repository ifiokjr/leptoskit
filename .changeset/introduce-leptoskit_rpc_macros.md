# leptoskit_rpc_macros: RPC attributes

`leptoskit_rpc_macros` provides the attributes behind `leptoskit_rpc`: `#[query]`, `#[mutation]`, and `#[action]` declare operations; `#[stream]`, `#[channel]`, `#[job]`, and `#[cron]` declare live streams, channels, background jobs, and scheduled jobs; and `#[api]` publishes a leptos server function to generated clients.

Use them through `leptoskit_rpc`, which re-exports them. Every target gets the operation's typed argument struct so any client can call it; only a server build keeps the function body and registers its route.
