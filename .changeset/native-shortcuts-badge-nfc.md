# App shortcuts, icon badges, and NFC reads

Three new runtime plugins cover high-value native capabilities that were still missing:

- **`app-shortcuts`** publishes up to eight static launcher shortcuts (iOS quick actions, Android `ShortcutManager`, macOS dock-menu store) and returns the id that launched the app.
- **`badge`** sets, reads, and clears the app icon badge count on Apple and Android, with a Linux Unity/KDE D-Bus client for custom hosts.
- **`nfc`** queries hardware readiness and reads one bounded NDEF text or URI record on iOS and Android.

Each plugin ships guest clients, wire codecs, Apple/Android backends (with stubs where a platform has no hardware), docs, and tests. Windows jump-list publishing, full Siri App Intents, background NFC, and badge Badging API support remain follow-ups.
