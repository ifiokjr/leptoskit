# Paint italic text and per-edge borders on HarmonyOS

The ArkUI host now applies `italic` and per-edge `border_widths` (`border-t`, `border-l-2`, …) the same way Android and GTK do, instead of leaving those strokes undrawn and italic upright. Deno render tests lock the Yoga frames from `grid_parity_probe` so absolute ArkUI placement stays aligned with the web HTML probe.
