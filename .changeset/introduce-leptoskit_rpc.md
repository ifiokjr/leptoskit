# leptoskit_rpc: typed server operations

`leptoskit_rpc` is the boundary between an app's shared screens and its server. It adds retries and error classification to leptos server functions, and declares operations (`#[query]`, `#[mutation]`, `#[action]`) that run on the database as the signed-in caller and are called the same way from SSR, the browser, and a native guest through `client::call`.

The `live` feature serves queries over a WebSocket, with a server-sent events fallback, and pushes only what changed when a write commits; screens read them with `use_live`, and join channels with presence through `use_channel`. Live connections are bounded: a per-connection frame budget, a timeout for clients that stop reading, channel rooms tied to the arguments they were authorized for, and capped page sizes. `#[api]` publishes server functions so `leptoskit rpc generate` can write TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Dart, and command-line clients plus an OpenAPI document. Pick a database with the `postgres` or `sqlite` feature, and spread live updates across several servers with `relay`.
