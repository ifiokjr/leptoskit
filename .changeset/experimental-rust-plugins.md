# Try native plugins written only in Rust

Set `native.experimental-rust-plugins = true` in `leptoskit.toml` to use the experimental pure-Rust `clipboard` and `haptics` plugins on iOS, macOS, and Android in place of their Swift and Kotlin versions. Without the setting, builds keep the Swift and Kotlin versions.

A plugin of your own can do the same in its `[package.metadata.leptoskit.runtime]` tables. With `rust-context = true`, its factory receives a `leptoskit_bridge::AppContext`, whose `platform()` lends the host's native handles: the `JavaVM` and app `Context` on Android, and the on-screen view controller on iOS and macOS. With `rust-main-thread = true`, its calls run on the platform's UI thread, which UIKit, AppKit, and most Android UI APIs require (`App::install_main` installs such a plugin by hand). Mark a platform's registration `experimental = true` to use it only when the setting is on.
