# leptoskit_windows: the Windows backend

`leptoskit_windows` renders shared leptoskit elements as Win32 windows and native controls: every element owns a child window, and interactive elements, password fields included, use real Windows controls so keyboard and accessibility behave natively.

`leptoskit build --platform windows` produces an app that draws every component with it and embeds the common-controls manifest for you; a hand-written host must embed the crate's `app.manifest` itself. The backend stays on one UI thread, reuses the shared Yoga layout, and never embeds a browser. `Switch` is drawn as a checkbox, rounded corners have unsmoothed edges, and the generated app can't host plugins yet.
