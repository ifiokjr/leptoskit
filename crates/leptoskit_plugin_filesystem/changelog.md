### Breaking changes

#### leptoskit_plugin_filesystem: application files

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #429](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/429)

`leptoskit_plugin_filesystem` is the leptoskit plugin for application-private binary files on native and OPFS in the browser, with bounded messages.

Add `leptoskit_plugin_filesystem` as a direct dependency and select the `filesystem` plugin in `native.plugins`; the generated host discovers it from Cargo metadata, so registration is automatic. Guests enable the `guest` feature and reuse `guest::Filesystem` rather than resolving the plugin on every call. Every native path stays inside the application-owned data directory; guests cannot select an arbitrary filesystem root.

### Fixes

- **Correct README claims about generated renderers, accessibility, runtime plugin registration, password screens, RPC macros, and interpreter updates.** Share crate summaries with Rust documentation and derive MSRV badges from Cargo through MDT templates, with a documentation drift check. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #515](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/515)
