### Breaking changes

#### leptoskit_config: project configuration

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #429](https://github.com/ifiokjr/leptoskit/pull/429)

`leptoskit_config` loads and validates `leptoskit.toml`: app identity and platforms, server and build settings, native targets and plugin grants, code push channels, routes, translations, the database, sign-in, infrastructure, browser extensions, store publishing, plugins, formatting, and lint settings.

The CLI, build pipeline, dev server, and native hosts all read the same typed configuration, so they agree on what the app is. Unknown keys fail at load time instead of being ignored. The schema is versioned (version 0, unstable until version 1); `leptoskit migrate` upgrades an older file, and the `schema` feature generates its JSON Schema.

### Features

#### Try native plugins written only in Rust

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #506](https://github.com/ifiokjr/leptoskit/pull/506)

Set `native.experimental-rust-plugins = true` in `leptoskit.toml` to use the experimental pure-Rust `clipboard` and `haptics` plugins on iOS, macOS, and Android in place of their Swift and Kotlin versions. Without the setting, builds keep the Swift and Kotlin versions.

A plugin of your own can do the same in its `[package.metadata.leptoskit.runtime]` tables. With `rust-context = true`, its factory receives a `leptoskit_bridge::AppContext`, whose `platform()` lends the host's native handles: the `JavaVM` and app `Context` on Android, and the on-screen view controller on iOS and macOS. With `rust-main-thread = true`, its calls run on the platform's UI thread, which UIKit, AppKit, and most Android UI APIs require (`App::install_main` installs such a plugin by hand). Mark a platform's registration `experimental = true` to use it only when the setting is on.

### Fixes

- **Correct README claims about generated renderers, accessibility, runtime plugin registration, password screens, RPC macros, and interpreter updates.** Share crate summaries with Rust documentation and derive MSRV badges from Cargo through MDT templates, with a documentation drift check. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #515](https://github.com/ifiokjr/leptoskit/pull/515)
