### Breaking changes

#### leptoskit_plugin_os: host platform identity

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #429](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/429)

`leptoskit_plugin_os` is the leptoskit plugin for the host operating system and CPU architecture as seen from inside a Wasm guest.

Add `leptoskit_plugin_os` as a direct dependency and select the `os` plugin in `native.plugins`; the generated host discovers it from Cargo metadata, so registration is automatic. The values come from compile-time constants of the host build, so the guest sees the real platform even though its own target is wasm32.

### Fixes

- **Correct README claims about generated renderers, accessibility, runtime plugin registration, password screens, RPC macros, and interpreter updates.** Share crate summaries with Rust documentation and derive MSRV badges from Cargo through MDT templates, with a documentation drift check. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #515](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/515)
