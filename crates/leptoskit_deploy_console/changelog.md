### Breaking changes

#### leptoskit_deploy_console: self-hosted deployments

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #513](https://github.com/ifiokjr/leptoskit/pull/513)

`leptoskit_deploy_console` is the optional service behind `lk console`: one process that hosts the deployment dashboard, a durable operation queue, a scoped API for agents, and analytics history, backed by SQLite.

Run `lk console serve` on a trusted worker with Docker, OpenTofu, Kamal 2, Git, and SSH, then `lk console connect` from the app's checkout, and `lk infra plan`, `lk infra apply`, and `lk deploy` run through it. It reuses the CLI's OpenTofu and release engine, binds each apply to a reviewed plan, and keeps interrupted operations for explicit reconciliation. The `server` feature enables the service; the dashboard is a leptoskit component tree rendered on the server. It serves one owner's repositories and is not a multi-tenant executor.

### Fixes

- **Correct README claims about generated renderers, accessibility, runtime plugin registration, password screens, RPC macros, and interpreter updates.** Share crate summaries with Rust documentation and derive MSRV badges from Cargo through MDT templates, with a documentation drift check. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #515](https://github.com/ifiokjr/leptoskit/pull/515)
