### Breaking changes

#### leptoskit_android: the Android backend

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #429](https://github.com/ifiokjr/leptoskit/pull/429)

`leptoskit_android` is the Android Views backend: it applies the shared mutation stream to real Android views, with Yoga owning exact outer frames and Android owning each control's interior.

Compile `android/WidgetHost.kt` into an Android app and construct `AndroidBackend::new` on the UI thread. Every built-in primitive renders a real view; callbacks propose typed events that the app commits through `NativeSurface`.

### Fixes

- **Correct README claims about generated renderers, accessibility, runtime plugin registration, password screens, RPC macros, and interpreter updates.** Share crate summaries with Rust documentation and derive MSRV badges from Cargo through MDT templates, with a documentation drift check. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #515](https://github.com/ifiokjr/leptoskit/pull/515)
