### Breaking changes

#### leptoskit_virtual: headless virtualization

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #429](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/429)

`leptoskit_virtual` is headless list virtualization in the style of TanStack Virtual: fixed or measured sizes, overscan, aligned scroll targets, and a window over the shared renderer.

It decides which items a viewport intersects so a ten-thousand-row list only builds the visible rows, on web and native alike. Feed a `Virtualizer` the viewport size and scroll offset, render the window with `VirtualList` (vertical or horizontal), and hand back real sizes with `measure` as items are laid out.

### Fixes

- **Correct README claims about generated renderers, accessibility, runtime plugin registration, password screens, RPC macros, and interpreter updates.** Share crate summaries with Rust documentation and derive MSRV badges from Cargo through MDT templates, with a documentation drift check. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #515](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/515)
