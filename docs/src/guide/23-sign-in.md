# Sign-in

Sign-in is the part of an app where small mistakes are the most expensive. Session tokens get stored as they are, so a leaked database backup signs everyone in. A form says "no account with that email", which tells an attacker whose accounts exist. A code can be guessed because nothing counts the guesses. And one server function forgets to check who is asking.

`leptoskit::auth` handles all of these in one place, in your app's own database. It keeps only hashes of tokens and codes, gives the same answer for every address, and limits every attempt. It also tells your access policies who is signed in, so each table's rules apply on every query.

## Add the auth tables

Sign-in keeps its tables in your database as a [schema pack](22-database.md#tables-that-come-from-a-library). Turn on the `auth` feature next to your database feature, then add the pack in the crate that declares your tables:

```toml
leptoskit = { version = "…", features = ["auth", "db-postgres"] }
```

```rust
leptoskit::db::packs!(leptoskit_auth);
```

Your next `leptoskit db migration create` adds the tables, in the `auth` namespace:

| Table         | What it holds                                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `accounts`    | One row per person: when they joined, and whether the account is disabled.       |
| `emails`      | The addresses each account has proved it receives mail at.                       |
| `sessions`    | Signed-in devices: a hash of each token, its lifetimes, and a label.             |
| `challenges`  | Codes in flight, as keyed hashes. They expire and work once.                     |
| `events`      | The audit trail: sign-ups, sign-ins, failures, and revocations, with IP address. |
| `rate_limits` | Attempt counters, keyed by a hash, so the table holds no addresses.              |

## Connect your user table

Give your user table the account's key, so `Id<auth::Account>` names the user too. Deleting an account then deletes its user:

```rust
#[db::table(name = "users", public)]
pub struct User {
	#[db(on_delete = cascade)]
	pub id: Id<auth::Account>,
	pub name: String,
}
```

Create the user's row when the account is created, with `OnSignUp`. It runs inside the transaction that creates the account, so if it fails, nothing is created:

```rust
impl auth::OnSignUp for User {
	async fn on_sign_up(tx: &db::Tx, account: Id<auth::Account>, profile: &auth::Profile) -> auth::Result<()> {
		let name = profile.name.clone().unwrap_or_else(|| "New user".into());
		NewUser { id: account, name }.insert(tx).await?;
		Ok(())
	}
}
```

## Start the service

Build one `Auth` when the server starts, and share it:

```rust
let auth = auth::Auth::builder(&db, auth::Keys::from_env("AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEYS")?)
	.app_name("My App")
	.mailer(my_mailer)
	.on_sign_up::<User>()
	.build()?;
```

`AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEYS` holds the server's keys, newest first, as `id:key` pairs, where each key is 32 random bytes in base64url:

```sh
echo "AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEYS=$(date +%Y-%m):$(openssl rand 32 | basenc --base64url | tr -d =)"
```

The newest key hashes new codes, and any listed key checks one. To rotate, put a new key first and keep the old one until the codes it hashed have expired. Keep the variable in your secret store, never in `leptoskit.toml`.

A mailer is anything that implements `auth::Mailer`, which takes a few lines over your email provider's HTTP API. In development and tests, `auth::Mailbox` keeps every email instead of sending it.

## Sign in with an emailed code

One flow both signs in and signs up. Ask for a code, and the person receives one by email:

```rust
auth.send_email_code(&address, &request).await?;
```

The answer is the same for every valid address, whether or not it has an account, so the form can't be used to find out who has signed up. When the person types the code, check it:

```rust
let sign_in = auth.verify_email_code(&address, &code, &request).await?;
// sign_in.token goes to the device; sign_in.signed_up says whether the account is new
```

A code proves the address. If the address has an account, this signs in to it. If it doesn't, this creates the account and runs your `OnSignUp`. The rules on codes:

- A code is eight letters and digits, such as `K7QM-R2XD`. Case, spaces, and the dash don't matter.
- It works once, for 10 minutes, for its own address only. Asking for a new code retires the old one.
- After five wrong guesses it stops working. A wrong code, an expired code, and an address with no code all fail the same way, with `AuthError::InvalidCode`.

`request` is an `auth::RequestInfo`: the client's IP address and user agent. They're used for rate limits, the audit trail, and the device's label in a list of sessions, such as "Firefox on macOS".

## Sessions

A session token is 256 random bits. The device keeps it, and the database keeps only its SHA-256 hash, so a copy of the database signs no one in. On each request, turn the token back into the person:

```rust
let signed_in = auth.resolve(&auth::SessionToken::new(token)).await?;   // Option<auth::SignedIn>
```

A session ends after 14 days unused, or after 90 days however often it's used; `SessionLifetimes` changes both. `resolve` returns `None` for a token that is unknown, expired, revoked, or whose account is disabled.

To end sessions:

- `auth.sign_out(&token, &request)` ends the current session.
- `auth.revoke(&signed_in, session_id, &request)` ends one of the person's other sessions, such as a lost phone's. It never touches anyone else's.
- `auth.revoke_others(&signed_in, &request)` ends every session but the current one.
- `auth.rotate(&signed_in, &request)` replaces the current token with a new one, so a token captured earlier stops working. Rotate whenever the person's privileges change.
- `auth.disable(account, &request)` stops an account from signing in and ends every session it has. `auth.enable(account)` lets it sign in again.

## Rules about the signed-in person

Give each request a database handle that knows who it's for:

```rust
let db = db.with_context(auth::context(signed_in));
```

Policies then read the signed-in person through `cx.signed_in`, which matches nothing for a signed-out request:

```rust
use leptoskit::auth::AuthContext;

#[db::table(name = "posts")]
#[db::policy(all, |post, cx| cx.signed_in(|me| post.author_id.eq(me.user_id())))]
pub struct Post {
	pub id: Id<Post>,
	pub author_id: Id<User>,
	pub body: String,
}
```

`me.user_id()` is the person's ID in your user table, since it shares the account's key.

The auth tables have policies of their own. A signed-in person reads only their own account, emails, sessions, and events, and nobody reads codes or rate-limit counters. Only `leptoskit_auth` writes any of them.

## Limits

Every step is rate limited, by address and by IP address:

| Step         | Default limit                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Sending code | 5 per address per 15 minutes; 20 per IP per hour |
| Checking one | 30 per IP per 15 minutes, and 5 guesses per code |

Change them with `Limits`. An attempt over the limit fails with `AuthError::RateLimited`, which says how long to wait. The counters live in `auth.rate_limits`, and concurrent attempts can't both take the last one. To count somewhere faster, such as Redis, implement `auth::RateLimiter`.

## Test sign-in

`auth::Mailbox` keeps the emails a test sends, so a test signs in the way a person would:

```rust
let mailbox = auth::Mailbox::new();
let auth = auth::Auth::builder(&db, auth::Keys::single("test", [7; 32]))
	.mailer(mailbox.clone())
	.on_sign_up::<User>()
	.build()?;

auth.send_email_code("ada@example.com", &auth::RequestInfo::default()).await?;
let mail = mailbox.latest_to("ada@example.com").unwrap();
let code = mail.subject.rsplit(' ').next().unwrap();
let sign_in = auth.verify_email_code("ada@example.com", code, &auth::RequestInfo::default()).await?;
```
